# SE452-WildCard
Group 7 Project Submission for course SE452 at DePaul University

Team Wildcard will be developing an application that’s similar to DePaul’s Campus Connect application, which is a web portal that allows students to perform self-service tasks related to their coursework. We will be creating a similar portal that delivers a subset of features such as adding courses, dropping courses, viewing grades/progress, and managing personal information.
